1. **Scanner**: Files related to scanning tools (e.g., Nmap, Masscan).
2. **Exploitation**: Files concerning exploitation tools (e.g., Metasploit, various exploits).
3. **Web_Tools**: Files associated with web tools (e.g., Burp Suite, DirBuster).
4. **Password_Cracking**: Files linked to password cracking tools (e.g., Hydra, John the Ripper).
5. **Sniffing**: Files involving sniffing tools (e.g., Wireshark, Tcpdump).
6. **Other**: Files that do not belong to any of the above categories.

[[OVERVIEW]]
Machine learning models can be trained using labeled datasets of cybersecurity tools to predict categories like ‚ÄúScanner,‚Äù ‚ÄúExploitation,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWeb Tools.‚Äù For example:
	‚Ä¢	Tools like Wireshark and Tcpdump can be categorized under ‚ÄúSniffing.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Tools like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike fall under ‚ÄúExploitation‚Äù.

[[V1.2 Change Log]]
 Updates to Training Data:
	1.	Scanner: Added tools like Shodan, TheHarvester.
	2.	Exploitation: Included SQLMap, Cobalt Strike, Empire.
	3.	Web_Tools: Added OWASP ZAP, WPScan.
	4.	Password_Cracking: Expanded with Hashcat, Cain & Abel.
	5.	Sniffing: Added Kismet, Aircrack-ng.
	6.	Encryption: Included VeraCrypt, AxCrypt, Tor, NordLocker.
	7.	Network_Defense: Added Snort, Suricata, pfSense, AlienVault OSSIM.
 
How It Works:
	1.	Categories: Expanded categories now include encryption tools and network defense tools alongside the original ones.
	2.	Training Data: Richer examples ensure better categorization accuracy.
	3.	Classifier: Uses TF-IDF vectorization and Naive Bayes classification.

# üìÅ File Management Script V 1.3 

Welcome to the **File Management Script**! This script is designed for efficiently moving or copying files within your system while providing a user-friendly interface and robust error handling.

## üìà Improvements

We have made several enhancements to this script to ensure an improved user experience:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Error Handling
- **Robustness**: The implementation of a `try...except` block in the `move_or_copy_files` function allows the script to handle errors gracefully, preventing crashes and providing useful feedback to users.

### üåü User-Friendly Interface
- **Interactive Experience**: Users can now input their desired actions directly, making the script more engaging and easier to use. Simply type your command and press `Enter` to execute!

### üîç Clearer Logic
- **Organized Structure**: The code has been refactored for clarity and simplicity. Well-organized functions and logical flow make it easy to follow and understand, even for those new to programming.

### üóÉÔ∏è Preserves Metadata
- **Metadata Integrity**: When using `shutil.copy2`, the script ensures that file metadata (like creation and modification times) is preserved during the copy process, keeping your file's history intact.

### ‚ùå Value Error Handling
- **Validation**: The code now raises a `ValueError` if a user enters an invalid action, ensuring that users are informed of mistakes and can correct them immediately.

## üìú How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-management-script.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd file-management-script
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python file_manager.py
   ```

4. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: Input your desired action when prompted.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Move or copy files with ease.
- Intuitive user input method.
- Enhanced error messaging for a smoother experience.

V 1.4 CHANGELOG

````markdown
magic Library:‚Ä¢import magic is added. This library is used for file type detection. You'll need to install it: pip install python-magic (or pip install python-magic-bin on Windows).2._extract_metadata Method:‚Ä¢This new private method is added to the CybersecurityFileCategorizer class.‚Ä¢Purpose: It extracts metadata from a given file.‚Ä¢Logic:‚Ä¢It uses magic.from_file(filepath) to get the file type.‚Ä¢It uses os.path.getsize(filepath) to get the file size.‚Ä¢It uses os.path.getctime(filepath) and os.path.getmtime(filepath) to get the creation and modification times, respectively.‚Ä¢It formats the timestamps using datetime.fromtimestamp().strftime().‚Ä¢It returns a dictionary containing the extracted metadata.‚Ä¢It includes error handling in case metadata extraction fails.3.analyze_files Method:‚Ä¢This new method is added to the CybersecurityFileCategorizer class.‚Ä¢Purpose: It analyzes files in the input directory, extracts metadata, and generates a report.‚Ä¢Logic:‚Ä¢It creates an empty dictionary analysis_results to store the results.‚Ä¢It calls self.categorize_files() to get the categorization results.‚Ä¢It iterates through the files in the input directory.‚Ä¢For each file, it calls self._extract_metadata() to get the metadata.‚Ä¢It stores the metadata and the category (from categorization_results) in the analysis_results dictionary.‚Ä¢It returns the analysis_results dictionary.4.generate_analysis_report Method:‚Ä¢This new method is added to the CybersecurityFileCategorizer class.‚Ä¢Purpose: It generates a report of the file analysis and saves it to a JSON file.‚Ä¢Logic:‚Ä¢It takes the analysis_results dictionary as input.‚Ä¢It uses json.dump() to save the results to a JSON file (default name: analysis_report.json).‚Ä¢It includes error handling in case report generation fails.5.main Function Refactoring:‚Ä¢The main function is significantly refactored to include a menu system.‚Ä¢Menu:‚Ä¢It presents a menu with options: "Categorize Files," "Analyze Files," and "Exit."‚Ä¢It uses a while loop to keep the menu running until the user chooses to exit.‚Ä¢It uses input() to get the user's choice.‚Ä¢Choice Handling:‚Ä¢Choice 1 (Categorize Files):‚Ä¢It calls categorizer.categorize_files().‚Ä¢It prints the results.‚Ä¢It saves the results to CSV and PDF.‚Ä¢It asks the user if they want to copy or move the files.‚Ä¢Choice 2 (Analyze Files):‚Ä¢It calls categorizer.analyze_files().‚Ä¢It prints the analysis results, including metadata and category.‚Ä¢It calls categorizer.generate_analysis_report() to save the report to a JSON file.‚Ä¢Choice 3 (Exit):‚Ä¢It breaks out of the while loop, ending the program.‚Ä¢Invalid Choice:‚Ä¢It prints an error message if the user enters an invalid choice.6.File Metadata Storage:‚Ä¢The CybersecurityFileCategorizer class now has a self.file_metadata dictionary to store the extracted metadata.7.Import json:‚Ä¢Added import json to the top of the file.How to Run the Updated Code:````
