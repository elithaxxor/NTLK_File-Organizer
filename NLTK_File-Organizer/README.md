# NLTK File Organizer

## Overview

This document describes the updates and features added to the `CybersecurityFileCategorizer` class, which utilizes the NLTK library for organizing your cybersecurity tools.

## Features

### 1. Magic Library
- **Import**: `import magic` is added for file type detection.
- **Installation**: 
  ```bash
  pip install python-magic  # For Linux/MacOS
  pip install python-magic-bin  # For Windows
  ```

### 2. `_extract_metadata` Method
- **Purpose**: Extracts metadata from a given file.
- **Logic**:
  - Uses `magic.from_file(filepath)` to get the file type.
  - Uses `os.path.getsize(filepath)` to get the file size.
  - Uses `os.path.getctime(filepath)` and `os.path.getmtime(filepath)` to get the creation and modification times, respectively.
  - Formats the timestamps using `datetime.fromtimestamp().strftime()`.
  - Returns a dictionary containing the extracted metadata.
  - Includes error handling in case metadata extraction fails.

### 3. `analyze_files` Method
- **Purpose**: Analyzes files in the input directory, extracts metadata, and generates a report.
- **Logic**:
  - Creates an empty dictionary `analysis_results` to store the results.
  - Calls `self.categorize_files()` to get the categorization results.
  - Iterates through the files in the input directory.
  - For each file, calls `self._extract_metadata()` to get the metadata.
  - Stores the metadata and the category (from categorization results) in the `analysis_results` dictionary.
  - Returns the `analysis_results` dictionary.

### 4. `generate_analysis_report` Method
- **Purpose**: Generates a report of the file analysis and saves it to a JSON file.
- **Logic**:
  - Takes the `analysis_results` dictionary as input.
  - Uses `json.dump()` to save the results to a JSON file (default name: `analysis_report.json`).
  - Includes error handling in case report generation fails.

### 5. `main` Function Refactoring
- **Menu System**:
  - Presents a menu with options: "Categorize Files," "Analyze Files," and "Exit."
  - Uses a `while` loop to keep the menu running until the user chooses to exit.
  - Uses `input()` to get the user's choice.
- **Choice Handling**:
  - **Choice 1 (Categorize Files)**:
    - Calls `categorizer.categorize_files()`.
    - Prints the results.
    - Saves the results to CSV and PDF.
    - Asks the user if they want to copy or move the files.
  - **Choice 2 (Analyze Files)**:
    - Calls `categorizer.analyze_files()`.
    - Prints the analysis results, including metadata and category.
    - Calls `categorizer.generate_analysis_report()` to save the report to a JSON file.
  - **Choice 3 (Exit)**:
    - Breaks out of the `while` loop, ending the program.
  - **Invalid Choice**:
    - Prints an error message if the user enters an invalid choice.

### 6. File Metadata Storage
- The `CybersecurityFileCategorizer` class now has a `self.file_metadata` dictionary to store the extracted metadata.

### 7. Import `json`
- Added `import json` to the top of the file.

## How to Run the Updated Code

1. Ensure all required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install python-magic
   pip install json
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python categorize.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to categorize or analyze your files.
